# Low-Level HTTP2 Connector

The Low-Level HTTP2 Connector is a lightweight and versatile HTTP2 library designed for superior performance compared to standard `net/http` packages in Go and equivalent libraries in Python. This library offers easy integration with both Go and Python applications, making it an ideal choice for projects that demand optimized HTTP2 connections.

## Key Features

- Enhanced Performance: The library is meticulously crafted to deliver higher performance than conventional `net/http` packages and their Python equivalents.
- Simple Integration: Seamlessly integrates with both Go and Python applications, allowing developers to harness the power of low-level HTTP2 connectivity.
